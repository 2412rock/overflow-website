    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Last Updated: 8 May 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the Uptime Monitor app. We are committed to maintaining your trust by protecting your data and respecting your privacy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Monitoring Configuration:</strong> URLs and endpoints that you manually add for uptime checks.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic device info (OS, model, etc.) to support app performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Push Notification Token:</strong> If you enable alerts, we use your device token to send notifications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Uptime Monitoring:</strong> To check the availability of your services and alert you to outages.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To notify you when your monitored services go down or recover.</li>
        <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> To debug issues and improve app stability and features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All monitoring configurations and data are stored securely.</li>
        <li>We use encryption for sensitive information when applicable.</li>
        <li>Access to your data is restricted to authorized personnel only.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party services such as Firebase for notifications and analytics. These providers have their own privacy policies and are committed to secure data handling.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Your configuration data is retained as long as your account is active or until you delete it through the app. Push tokens are discarded when notifications are disabled.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>

        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You may delete your data and account from the app.</li>
